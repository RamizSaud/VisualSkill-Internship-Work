# VisualSkill Internship Projects

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at VisualSkill, covering three major projects in the field of machine learning and computer vision. Each project tackles a unique problem, utilizing advanced models and techniques.

## Project 1: Image Classification and Object Detection with CNN

### Overview
In this project, I focused on both image classification and object detection tasks using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.

### Dataset
- **COCO dataset**: A widely used dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning. 

### Highlights
- Employed CNN architectures to effectively classify images and detect objects within the COCO dataset.
- Explored and applied various preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance.

## Project 2: Object Detection with YOLOv8

### Overview
The second project aimed at detecting objects using the YOLOv8 model, with a special focus on identifying potholes.

### Dataset
- **Custom Pothole Dataset**: Created and annotated a custom dataset comprising images of potholes for training the YOLOv8 model.

### Highlights
- Successfully trained the YOLOv8 model on the custom pothole dataset to detect potholes with high accuracy.
- Implemented data augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model against different lighting conditions and angles.

## Project 3: Review Classification with BERT Transformer

### Overview
The third project involved classifying reviews using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.

### Dataset
- **Amazon Dataset**: Utilized a dataset of Amazon product reviews for the task.

### Highlights
- Applied the BERT Transformer model for the classification of textual reviews into sentiment categories.
- Fine-tuned the BERT model to adapt to the nuances of the Amazon review dataset, achieving significant accuracy in sentiment classification.

## Conclusion
These projects have provided me with a profound understanding of machine learning and computer vision techniques, from basic image classification to complex object detection and natural language processing tasks. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply these advanced technologies in practical scenarios and contribute to the field.

Thank you for exploring my internship projects. For more details on each project, please refer to the individual folders within this repository.
